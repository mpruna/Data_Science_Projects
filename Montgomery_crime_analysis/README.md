Analyzing Montgomery County crimes to find useful patterns

Montgomery is a county in the Maryland US located on the east coast Montgomery County, Maryland.
Improvement of various aspects of social life entitles a proactive and reactive analysis. With this in mind I will be looking to to find patterns by performing time, location and crime classification analysis. For this project I will heavily rely on graph visualization as a picture worths a thousand words.
Here are some conclusion highlights:

Time analysis:
  * Most of the crimes are committed Tuesday
  * On 24 hour basis most of the crimes are committed between 7 a.m - 11 p.m
  * October has the highest crime count

Classification analysis:
  * Violent/Non-Violent crimes rates are pretty even 42.8%/57.2%

Location analysis:
  * Cities with highest crime counts are : Silver Spring, Rockville, Gaithersburg
  * Most of the crimes happen in the street, residence or parking lot
  * Silver Spring Police District has the highest crime rates

Github cannot render plotly graphs. This is a known issue. I use plotly due to their enhanced aesthetics.
